# What-should-patients-expect-during-their-first-consultation-at-Ayuh-Fertility-Centre-

Going for your first fertility consultation can be stressful. Most couples donâ€™t know what to expect, what papers to bring, or even what to say. But at Ayuh Fertility Centre in Ahmedabad, they try to make it a relaxed and comforting experience â€” especially if it's your first time speaking about fertility issues.

When you walk into the clinic, the staff at the reception is polite and helpful. The atmosphere is calm â€” no crowded waiting areas or rushed vibes like some big hospitals. Most people meet Dr. Krupa A. Shah herself during the first visit. She listens carefully and doesnâ€™t rush through your story. That really helps, because a lot of couples are carrying stress, confusion, or even guilt after trying to conceive for months or years.

In the first appointment, the doctor will ask questions about your medical history â€” like how long youâ€™ve been trying, if thereâ€™s been any miscarriages, periods regular or not, past surgeries, or any known health issues in either partner. Sheâ€™ll also want to know about your lifestyle â€” smoking, alcohol, weight, diet, work stress, sleep, and all that. Itâ€™s best to be honest during this.

Then she may recommend a few basic tests. For women, this can include blood work to check hormones, AMH (egg reserve), ultrasound to look at uterus and ovaries. For men, itâ€™s usually a semen analysis. Donâ€™t worry â€” none of these tests are painful or complicated. Some of them may already be done if youâ€™ve visited other clinics before. If yes, you can just bring old reports.

After all this, Dr. Krupa will explain whatâ€™s going on â€” in simple words, not just medical jargon. Whether itâ€™s PCOS, low sperm count, unexplained infertility, or age-related egg decline â€” she helps you understand it and then gives options. She may suggest timed intercourse, IUI, IVF, or ICSI, based on whatâ€™s right for your case.

You also get an idea about cost, time needed, success chances, and whether any medicines or injections will be needed. Nothing is forced. If you need time to think or talk with family, theyâ€™re totally okay with that. Thatâ€™s something patients really appreciate about Ayuh.

So honestly, the first consultation is not scary. Itâ€™s more like a starting point â€” you come out knowing more and feeling less alone in the journey.
